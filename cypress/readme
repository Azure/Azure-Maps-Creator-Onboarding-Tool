To run cypress tests you need to provide two env variables - baseUrl and subscriptionKey.
A good way to set them locally would be to create cypress.env.json file in the root of the project:

{
"baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",
"subscriptionKey": "my-subscription-key"
}

More information on env variables can be found here https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables
